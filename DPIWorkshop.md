# Summer Professional Development in VR/AR for Teachers oF Computer Science

Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) application development offers an engaging way to teach a variety of important topics in computer science, including user interface design, computer graphics, and software engineering. In this hands-on session, participants will learn the fundamentals of VR/AR application development. We will survey popular VR/AR platforms and development kits, and implement a simple VR game using the popular Unity game engine. Participants will be involved in discussions about how they can integrate programming activities related to VR/AR in their classrooms.
